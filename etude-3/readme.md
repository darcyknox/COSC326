Error handling working.
Maybe needs to break instead of return from catching an error.
Look into better error handling techniques.

Clean up code and change the left to right function.

I think I can change the left to right function to be the same as the normal,
but instead of evaluating at the end, it needs to keep track of a current value throughout the function.
